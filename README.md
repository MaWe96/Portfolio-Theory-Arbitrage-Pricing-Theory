Arbitrage Pricing Theory in Portfolio Theory.

This repository features a research paper that explores the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model within the framework of Portfolio Theory. The paper outlines the APT formula, reviews existing literature on the model, and discusses its connection to utility-based arguments and mean-variance efficiency. Finally, the paper covers the empirical tests conducted on APT and highlights its practical applications, while also addressing potential errors in its empirical tests.
